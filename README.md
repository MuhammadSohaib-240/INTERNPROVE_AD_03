## Description

This project is a simple and user-friendly stopwatch application developed as part of my internship educational program. The stopwatch includes standard functionalities like starting, pausing, resetting, and recording laps. It's built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, providing a modern, declarative UI experience for Android users.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Timer**: Control the stopwatch with a start, stop, and reset button.
- **Lap Recording**: Record multiple lap times while the stopwatch is running.
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Enjoy a smooth and modern UI design powered by Jetpack Compose.
- **Kotlin-based Backend**: The stopwatch logic is entirely written in Kotlin for efficient performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Programming language for building the app's logic.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for designing the user interface.
- **Coroutines**: Ensures seamless background processing for the stopwatch functionality.

## Usage

1. Install the APK on your Android device.
2. Start the stopwatch by tapping the Start button.
3. Record lap times while the stopwatch is running.
4. Stop or reset the stopwatch as needed.
5. View the list of recorded laps.
